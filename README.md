Setup Intructions

NOTE: This code base does not include any of the Drupal Core files. It is only a sub-theme of Zen, based on Neptune.

1. run $ npm install
2. grunt dev
    - This will build the the dev folder, create the css files, and move any needed files.
    - The content of this folder can then be moved to your drupal code base.
